# pktvisor Taps

## Summary

Taps are named, host specific connection specifications for the raw input streams accessed by pktvisord. They represent
configuration data only; they do not cause any processing to take place in pktvisord. They should be referenced by
Collection Policies (#76) by name.

The goal of Taps is to abstract away host level details such as ethernet interface or dnstap socket location so that
collection policies can apply to a broad set of pktvisor agents without worrying about these details. It also provides
for an easy way to integrate with existing configuration management stacks which will hold the source of truth for this
type of information.

Taps should be configured on the command line at agent start up. In the future, the admin API will also accept tap
creation; the specification for this will be in a separate RFC.

`taps.yaml`

```yaml
version: "1.0"

visor:
  # each tap has input module specific configuration options
  taps:
    # a pcap tap which uses eth0 and is referenced by the identifier "anycast"
    anycast:
      type: pcap
      config:
        iface: eth0
    # an sflow tap which listens on the given IP and port, referenced by the identifier "pop_switch"
    pop_switch:
      type: sflow
      config:
        port: 6343
        bind: 192.168.1.1
    # a dnstap tap which gets its stream from the given socket, named "trex_tap"
    trex_tap:
      type: dnstap
      config:
        socket: /var/dns.sock
```

## Standalone Command Line Example
