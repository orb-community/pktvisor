# Stream Handler Modules

This directory contains the built-in stream handler modules. These attach to [stream input events](/src/inputs) and
summarize them, typically using a time window of efficient sketch algorithms and counters which are exposed as metrics.

See the individual READMEs for more information:

* [DHCP](dhcp/)
* [DNS](dns/)
* [Mock](mock/)
